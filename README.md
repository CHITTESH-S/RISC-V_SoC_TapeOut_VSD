Welcome all to my GitHub repo for the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program by VSD** — the **master-log** for the tapeout journey. Each week has its own **sub-repo** with detailed labs, scripts, and results.

## 🔍 Program Overview

**🎯 Objective:** Learn the complete SoC design flow and achieve a tapeout-ready design.  

**❓ Why:**

🔧 Gain hands-on experience with RTL, synthesis, physical design, and verification.

🇮🇳 Contribute to India’s semiconductor ecosystem.

📚 Create reproducible documentation for learning and collaboration.

**🖥️ Environment:** Ubuntu 22.04 + open-source EDA toolchain

## 🧰 Toolchain Setup (Week 0 Highlights)

> The open-source stack powering this SoC journey:

✅ Icarus Verilog — simulation & testbenches.

✅ GTKWave — waveform visualization.

✅ Yosys — RTL synthesis and optimization.

✅ Ngspice — circuit & mixed-signal simulation (where needed).

✅ Magic — layout editing, DRC, LVS.

✅ OpenLane — automated RTL → GDSII flow using Sky130 PDK.

✅ SkyWater SKY130 PDK — standard-cell & design rules (local or containerized install).

**Achievements in Week 0:**  

🟢 Installed tools and validated presence: yosys -V, iverilog -v, gtkwave --version, openlane --version (where applicable).

🧭 Configured environment variables and PATH entries for reproducibility (example .bashrc/.zshrc snippets included).

🐳 Docker / Container Notes: prepared container image and docker-compose snippets for reproducible flows (OpenLane + PDK in container).

## 🗓️ Weekly Journey & Checkpoints

Each week is like a **milestone card**:

### 🟢 Week 0 — Environment Setup ✅

🟢 Installed tools and validated presence: yosys -V, iverilog -v, gtkwave --version, openlane --version (where applicable).

🧭 Configured environment variables and PATH entries for reproducibility (example .bashrc/.zshrc snippets included).

🐳 Docker / Container Notes: prepared container image and docker-compose snippets for reproducible flows (OpenLane + PDK in container).

🔁 Backup & snapshot: PDK and critical tool artifacts backed up and hashed for future verification.

### 🟢 Week 1 — RTL Design Basics & Gate-Level Synthesis ✅

✍️ Verilog RTL to Simulation — Wrote modular RTL, created testbenches, simulated with Icarus Verilog, and visualized outputs in GTKWave.

⏱️ Timing & Synthesis — Explored Sky130 .lib timing libraries, performed hierarchical vs flat synthesis, and reused submodules for efficiency.

⚡ Optimizations — Applied Boolean simplification, shift-based multiplications, and pruning of unused logic; compared pre vs post optimization netlist stats in Yosys.

🔗 Gate-Level Verification — Ran GLS on synthesized netlists, understood blocking vs non-blocking assignments, and identified synthesis–simulation mismatches.

🧱 RTL-to-Hardware Mapping — Studied how if-else, case, and loops translate into gates, muxes, and flops; reinforced synthesis-friendly coding practices.

🚀 Milestone Insight — Learned that Verilog = Hardware, synthesis tools are powerful but not magical, and disciplined RTL design is the first big step toward tapeout.

### 🔵 Week 2 —  ⚡ *(Upcoming)*
