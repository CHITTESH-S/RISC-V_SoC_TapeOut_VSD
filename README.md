Welcome all to my github repo of the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program by VSD**.

From RTL to GDSII, This repository serves as the **master-log**, while each week’s detailed work has its own dedicated sub-repo.

## 🔍 Program Overview

**🎯 Objective:** Learn the complete SoC design flow and achieve a tapeout-ready design.  

**Why:**  
- Gain hands-on experience with RTL, synthesis, physical design, and verification.  
- Contribute to India’s semiconductor ecosystem.  
- Document all stages for reproducibility and learning.  

**Environment:** Ubuntu 22.04 + Open-source EDA toolchain.

## 🧰 Toolchain Setup (Week 0 Highlights)

> The open-source stack powering this SoC journey:

- 🟢 **Yosys** — RTL synthesis  
- 🟢 **Icarus Verilog** — Simulation & testbenches  
- 🟢 **GTKWave** — Waveform visualization  
- 🟢 **Ngspice** — Circuit & mixed-signal simulation  
- 🟢 **Magic** — Layout, DRC, LVS  
- 🟢 **OpenLane** — RTL → GDSII full flow  

**Achievements in Week 0:**  
- Installed all tools and configured environment variables.  
- Verified sample RTL, simulation, and synthesis runs.  
- Learned the importance of version consistency and paths.
